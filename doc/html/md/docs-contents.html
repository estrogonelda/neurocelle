<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The program <em>Neurocelle</em> was intended for research use, helping researchers to<br>make models, like <em>Artificial Neural Networks</em> and <em>Multivariate Regressions</em>,<br>easily and on demand.</p>
<h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3>
<p>It can be downloaded directly from our <a href="https://github.com/estrogonelda/neurocelle">GitHub repository</a><br>via <strong>http</strong> protocol, or via <strong>git clone</strong> command like:<br>    $ git clone <a href="https://github.com/estrogonelda/neurocelle.git">https://github.com/estrogonelda/neurocelle.git</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Neurocelle</em> was developed on <em>Matlab</em> and need the <em>Matlab Compiler<br>Runtime</em> (MCR) to run properly. You can take the right version of MCR for your<br>computer from the <em>MathWorks&#39;</em> web site, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="instalation">Instalation</h3>
<p>After downloaded, <em>Neurocelle</em> can be installed either localy or remotely on a<br>server with the following commands on the terminal:<br>    $ cd neurocelle<br>    $ ./configure<br>    $ make install</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<h5 id="local-usage">Local usage</h5>
<p>After installed, <em>neurocelle</em> can be invoked from terminal with the command:<br>    $ ncl [options] file</p>
<p>Or the user can get help with<br>    $ ncl -h [command]</p>
<h5 id="remote-uploads">Remote Uploads</h5>
<p>The user can submit his project in our online <a href="../index.html">server</a> via compressed file<br>with a xml configuration file within it, up to 2 Mb. The user can find an<br>example of configuration file <a href="./md/config_file.xml">Here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>
<p><em>Neurocelle</em> was originaly developed as a monograph work for an Engineering<br>degree and has no comercial intend. So contribution on this project will stay<br>at the source development level. Nonetheless, sugestions and new modules ideas<br>will be appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
<p>This project was written by José L. L. Buzzo, a Biotechnological Engeneering<br>student of São Paulo State University in Brazil, from 2013 to 2017, when worked<br>as an intern at the MaAp Laboratory in FCLAs - UNESP.</p>
