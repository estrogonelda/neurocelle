### Introduction
The program *Neurocelle* was intended for research use, helping researchers to
make models, like *Artificial Neural Networks* and *Multivariate Regressions*,
easily and on demand.

### Downloads
It can be downloaded directly from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estrogonelda/neurocelle)
via **http** protocol, or via **git clone** command like:
    $ git clone https://github.com/estrogonelda/neurocelle.git

**Note:** *Neurocelle* was developed on *Matlab* and need the *Matlab Compiler
Runtime* (MCR) to run properly. You can take the right version of MCR for your
computer from the *MathWorks'* web site, [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).

### Instalation
After downloaded, *Neurocelle* can be installed either localy or remotely on a
server with the following commands on the terminal:
    $ cd neurocelle
    $ ./configure
    $ make install

### Usage
##### Local usage
After installed, *neurocelle* can be invoked from terminal with the command:
	$ ncl [options] file

Or the user can get help with
	$ ncl -h [command]

##### Remote Uploads
The user can submit his project in our online [server](../index.html) via compressed file
with a xml configuration file within it, up to 2 Mb. The user can find an
example of configuration file [Here](./md/config_file.xml).

### Contributing
*Neurocelle* was originaly developed as a monograph work for an Engineering
degree and has no comercial intend. So contribution on this project will stay
at the source development level. Nonetheless, sugestions and new modules ideas
will be appreciated.

### Credits
This project was written by José L. L. Buzzo, a Biotechnological Engeneering
student of São Paulo State University in Brazil, from 2013 to 2017, when worked
as an intern at the MaAp Laboratory in FCLAs - UNESP.
